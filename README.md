# About me

I'm a Physicist, currently working as a Research Fellow at the Institute of Information Science and Technologies ISTI of the National Research Council CNR in Pisa.

My research interests are on Neural Network models applied to medical images with a specific focus on explainable-by-design models for Deep Learning.

I've collaborated with @gianlucarloni to the repositories [ProtoPNet](https://github.com/andreaberti11235/ProtoPNet) and [dataset_utils](https://github.com/gianlucarloni/dataset_utils_scripts).
